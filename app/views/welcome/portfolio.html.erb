      <br><br>
      <div class="w3">
        Hi! My name is Ryan Zolper.<br><br><br>
        I am a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer.
        I live in St. Pete, Fl.<br>
        I left Bucknell University in December 2014 because I really didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. <br>
        I ended up learning to code at The Iron Yard Academy, and I've never made a better decision.<br><br>
        My favorite part of programming is the huge wealth of information available online;<br>
        If a client wants something done that I don't know how to do, I can learn to do it!

      <div class="w3">
        As a very recent graduate of The Iron Yard, and a newcomer to the art of coding,<br>
        I have one app that I am really proud of, and that is nearly ready for some real customers.<br><br>
        <span class="w2">Arrange An Exchange</span><br>
        AAE offers the opportunity to connect to another family anywhere in the world, and arrange a foreign exchange directly!<br>
        We provide a unique chance to cut out the "middle man" in foreign exchange, and save $5k+ from their grubby little hands.<br>
        For now it's still in development, but it will be fully functional soon!<br><br>

        <br><br>
        <span class="w2">Others</span><br>
          AAE is the culmination of my skills from my 12 weeks at TIY.<br>
          I have some other apps that I worked on while I was learning at my <a href="https://github.com/RyanZolper" class="w3">GitHub</a>.<br>
          It's pretty cool to look through my apps by their dates and see my skills progress.
